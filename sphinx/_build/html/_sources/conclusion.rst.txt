A Conclusion
=============

After researching and creating these maps, a clear conclusion can be made. The map that depicts the percentage of the population that is Black overlaid with the percentage of units flooded during Hurricane Katrina demonstrates a climate event that disproportionately impacted a vulnerable population. Situations such as these should be addressed, as we have seen how much this catastrophe has impacted the communities of New Orleans, specifically the Black community. Even to this day, many have not recovered mentally and physically. Looking back at the events that had unfolded, there were many ways the government could have handled the situation. To be better prepared, it is important we acknowledge our shortcomings and try to fix them. With these maps, it helps us understand which locations need more attention and care, should events such as these happen again.
As a whole, this is only one city with one climate issue. What is to be said for the rest of the world that we live in? Research like this should be continued in similar ways. Compiling data at a larger scale could be important. This could include entire states, the United States, or ideally continents. This would provide a way to figure out where the disparities are occurring. Climate data to be researched and overlay demographic data could include, but is not limited to, fires, floods, water contamination, soil contamination, and temperature. Hopefully maps such as these here can be made accessible and understandable to our population for better education on how the changing climate is unequally impacting peopleâ€™s lives.
