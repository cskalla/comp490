Climate Change
===================================================

Since the industrial revolution, the level of CO2 being released into the atmosphere due to human activity has increased exponentially. With CO2 as one of the heat-trapping greenhouse gasses, the earth has warmed in response. The ocean itself is a heat reservoir, as it contains about 90% of the Earth’s extra energy according to NASA (NASA, 2021). Not only are the ocean and air temperatures rising, the sea level is as well. The warmer ocean and air are causing the ice caps to melt and increase the level of the water. The sea level has risen about 8 inches in the last 100 years and the process is accelerating. This puts coastal cities at a higher risk of flooding.

Looking specifically at hurricanes, warmer surface water temperature of the ocean creates an environment for a more intense storm to develop. According to a 2014 study, “...the proportion of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes has increased at a rate of ~25-30 % per °C of global warming” (Holland, 2014). Additionally, warm air can hold more water. Therefore, when the air temperature is warmer during a hurricane, more rainfall occurs. This has led to increased flooding due to hurricanes in more recent years (Berardelli, 2019). It is important to keep these increasing values in mind and think about how they may worsen disparities.
